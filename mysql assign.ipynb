    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans.\n",
    "A1. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient data retrieval, management, and manipulation. Databases are essential in various applications, including websites, business systems, scientific research, and more, as they provide a systematic way to store, access, and update data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a differentiation between SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model:\n",
    "   - SQL Database: SQL databases are relational databases that use a structured schema to define the data's organization. Data is typically stored in tables with predefined schemas, and relationships between tables are established through keys (e.g., primary keys and foreign keys).\n",
    "   - NoSQL Database: NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that offer flexibility in data modeling. They can handle semi-structured or unstructured data, and their schema can be dynamic, allowing for changes in data structure without the need for a predefined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language:\n",
    "   - SQL Database: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL is a powerful and standardized language for working with structured data.\n",
    "   - NoSQL Database: NoSQL databases use various query languages or APIs specific to the database type. Examples include MongoDB's query language, Cassandra Query Language (CQL), or simple key-value access in databases like Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability:\n",
    "   - SQL Database: SQL databases are traditionally scaled vertically, meaning you increase the server's capacity (CPU, RAM, etc.) to handle more load. This can be expensive and has limits in terms of scalability.\n",
    "   - NoSQL Database: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability. They can distribute data across multiple servers or nodes, making them more suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Consistency vs. Flexibility:\n",
    "   - SQL Database: SQL databases emphasize data consistency and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. Transactions are typically fully ACID-compliant, ensuring data integrity but potentially sacrificing some scalability.\n",
    "   - NoSQL Database: NoSQL databases prioritize flexibility and often use BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) properties. This allows for high availability and performance but may temporarily sacrifice strict consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases:\n",
    "   - SQL Database: SQL databases are well-suited for applications with structured data and complex queries, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and traditional business applications.\n",
    "   - NoSQL Database: NoSQL databases are suitable for applications that require fast and flexible data storage and retrieval, including social media, real-time analytics, IoT (Internet of Things) applications, and content management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of your application. SQL databases are ideal for structured data and complex queries with a need for strong data consistency, while NoSQL databases offer flexibility and scalability for applications dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data and high traffic loads."

    "3. ALTER:\n",

    " \n",
    " ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
